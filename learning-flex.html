Flexbox (Flexible Box) is a layout model in CSS designed for building responsive and dynamic web layouts.
It provides a more efficient way to distribute space and align items within a container.
Flex containers are created using the display: flex; property.
The main axis and cross axis are fundamental concepts in flexbox layout.
The flex-direction property determines the direction of the main axis (row or column).
Items within a flex container can be aligned using the justify-content property.
The align-items property controls the alignment of items on the cross axis.
Flex items can be reordered using the order property.
The flex property is used to set the flexibility of a flex item.
Flex containers can adjust the size of their items based on available space using the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties.
Flexbox simplifies the creation of responsive layouts without relying heavily on floats or positioning.
It is well-suited for one-dimensional layouts, like navigation bars or lists.
Flexbox excels at distributing extra space or handling insufficient space among flex items.
It supports the creation of complex layouts with a more intuitive and concise syntax.
Flexbox is widely supported in modern browsers, making it a powerful tool for web developers.
